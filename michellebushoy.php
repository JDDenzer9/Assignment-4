		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Michelle, and I am a junior at University of Rochester. I am from the greater Boston area, and live in a suburb called Newton. I have an older sister named Yael. She is currently living in Manhattan and works at J.P. Morgan. I am studying Digital Media Studies with a minor in Computer Science. My scope of interest within my major lies in the intersection of code and design. I work best visually, and love seeing my designs come to life through code. Aside from my educational interests, I enjoy biking, traveling and walking my Irish Setter. My dog's name is Archie. </p>
